    <h1>Fridge Soup</h1>

    <p>If you eat a plant-based diet, this is an easy way to use up 
        aging produce and make a delicious dinner all at the same time.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Make the Base</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Broth - veggie, bone, water, other - some type of liquid</li>
                <li>Any large additions - left over beans, rice, lentils, potatoes, etc, that
                    need to be used</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h3>Add Starches</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you didn't add them in step one and only have small various amounts, 
                add them here. Hint: keep additional items on hand just for this (for example: small packages of 
                tiny pasta). Small amounts of dried rice, quinoa, beans, pasta - small amounts that are too small for a 
                complete meal work perfectly.
                </li>
               </ul>
        <li><h3>Add Vegetables</h3></li>
            <ul>Any vegetables, fruits, dried anything in small bits that need to 
                be used. Whatever you have and is hanging out in the fridge or
                pantry that will otherwise go unused.
            </ul>
        <li><h3>Add Seasonings</h3></li>
            <ul>Again, based on what you have you need to use. Hint: all those
                packets from takeout. Aging spices. Small amounts left in bottles
                and jars in the fridge. </ul>
