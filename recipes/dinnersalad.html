    <h1>Easy Weekday Dinner Salad</h1>
    <p>This is actually what is eaten, for dinner, on a daily basis around our 
        house. Lots of variety and a healthy, easy choice for busy weekday nights
        when you don't want to think about cooking and just want to eat.
    </p>
    <p>Prep takes about 15 minutes tops (depending on your knife skills)!</p>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Make the Base</h3></li>
            <ol>Romaine, greens, leaf mixes - the amount you use is based on your 
                personal diet. For reference, for two, we split a large head of romaine.
                This is a <i>dinner</i> salad - not a puny <i>side</i> salad.
            </ol>
