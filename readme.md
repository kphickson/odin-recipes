Currently working through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com) online lessons to refresh knowledge of html/css and learn Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. The recipe lesson (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), starts with basic html skills reviewed so far. Later, it will add css.
